// How to get a clone a project from gitLab or GitHub -> copy the HTTPS or SSH better use HTTPS Link and then use:
>git clone Link
for example from GitLab: Clone with HTTPS https://git.thm.de/ti2_2025/mi6-2/ag25.git 
to clone the project fro GitLab: git clone https://git.thm.de/ti2_2025/mi6-2/ag25.git -> now it is cloned in your machine 
//How to push the git repository for the 1st time in the GitLab or GitHub
/*
If you want to crate your own repository on GitHub or GitLab -> go to your account 
click on the add button -> create a new repository -> choose a name make some settings for exampe 
public or private and if want to initalize a Readme.md file -> crete project or repository -> done

how to conncet the local repository to the remote repository
advantge to use SSH you can push to the remote repository if you have a key
but if you  push with HTTPS, everytime you should log in to push so better to
push with the SSH Option
*/
/*
How to create a key 
ssh-keygen -o

/*
Example 
PS C:\Users\omara\Desktop\Technische Informatik Aufgabe> ssh-keygen -o       
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\omara/.ssh/id_ed25519):
C:\Users\omara/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\omara/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\omara/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:

-> fide the file in  .ssh
see -> Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\omara/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
-> open the file that ends with .pub -> copy the key and go to the profile -> settings -> add SSH key -> paste and done 
then in the git repository 
-> some instctions from the GitLab 


***
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.thm.de/oalj89/my-first-project-in-gitlab.git
git branch -M master
git push -uf origin master
***

-> insetad of HTTPS use the SSH 
->  git remote add origin git@git.thm.de:oalj89/my-first-project-in-gitlab.git
(Now there is a connection between the local repository and the remote repository)

// to set a remote-Verbindung use 
git remote set-url origin https://git.thm.de/ti2_2025/mi6-2/ag25.git
